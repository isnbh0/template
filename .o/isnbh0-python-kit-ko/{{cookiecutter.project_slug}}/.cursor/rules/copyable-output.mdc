# Copyable Output Formatting

Rule for ensuring consistent formatting of copyable text content in responses.

<rule>
name: "copyable-output"
description: "Guidelines for presenting copyable text output to users"
rules:
  - "When presenting text that is meant to be copied (e.g., changelogs, code snippets, configuration files), always wrap the content in triple backticks (```)"
  - "For code snippets, include the language identifier after the opening backticks for proper syntax highlighting (e.g., ```python, ```yaml)"
  - "For large blocks of plain text (like changelogs or documentation), use ```markdown to preserve formatting"
  - "When the content contains backticks itself, use four backticks (````) as delimiters to avoid formatting conflicts"
  - "Place each copyable block on its own line with empty lines before and after for clarity"
examples:
  - description: "Code snippet example"
    correct: |
      ```python
      def hello_world():
          print("Hello, World!")
      ```
  - description: "Changelog example"
    correct: |
      ```markdown
      # Changes
      - Added feature X
      - Fixed bug Y
      ```
  - description: "Content with backticks"
    correct: |
      ````
      Here's some text with `inline code`
      ````
